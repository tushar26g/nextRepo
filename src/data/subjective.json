Mr. Y also paid an amount of ` 50,000 towards advance as per the terms of the above contract. The mode of transportation available between their places is roadway only. Severe flood came on 2nd August, 2018 and the only road connecting their places was damaged and could not be repaired within fifteen days. Mr. X offered to supply sugar on 20th August, 2018 for which Mr. Y did not agree. On 1st September, 2018, Mr. X claimed compensation of ` 10,000 from Mr. Y for refusing to accept the supply of sugar, which was not there within the purview of the contract. On the other hand, Mr. Y claimed for refund of ` 50,000 which he had paid as advance in terms of the contract.

Mr. X informed the company that he had already cleared the dues and he is no more responsible for the same. He also contended that Mr. Z is an employee of the company to whom he had made the payment and being an outsider, he trusted the words of Mr. Z as duty distribution is a job of the internal management of the company. \n Analyse the situation and decide whether Mr. X is free from his liability based on the Doctrine of Indoor Management.",

The doctrine of constructive notice does not mean that outsiders are deemed to have notice of the internal affairs of the company. For instance, if an act is authorised by the articles or memorandum, an outsider is entitled to assume that all the detailed formalities for doing that act have been observed. The doctrine of Indoor Management is important to persons dealing with a company through its directors or other persons. They are entitled to assume that the acts of the directors or other officers of the company are validly performed, if they are within the scope of their apparent authority. So long as an act is valid under the articles, if done in a particular manner, an outsider dealing with the company is entitled to assume that it has been done in the manner required. In the given question, Mr. X has made payment to Mr. Z and he (Mr. Z) gave to receipt of the same to Mr. X. Thus, it will be rightful on part of Mr. X to assume that Mr. Z was also authorised to receive money on behalf of the company. Hence, Mr. X will be free from liability for payment of goods purchased from M/s ABC Limited, as he has paid amount due to an employee of the company"
